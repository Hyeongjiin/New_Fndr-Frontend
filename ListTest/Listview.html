            We provide a simple and clear payment API, which enables webshop and app builders to implement more than ten different payment methods in one go.In the first
             few years of existence, Mollie was a developer-only adventure and about 15 years later devs and techs still comprise roughly 30% of all staff. 
             As a natural consequence, Mollie still is—and aims to remain—highly tech-minded. We take a developers-first approach to our products and internal 
             development strategy, something that both our customers and our developers appreciate.
